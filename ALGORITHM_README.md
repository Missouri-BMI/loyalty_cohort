# Algorithm Details

Implements a loyalty cohort algorithm with the same general design defined in 
  *"External Validation of an Algorithm to Identify Patients with High Data-Completeness in Electronic Health Records for Comparative Effectiveness Research"* by Lin et al.
- Written primarily by Darren Henderson with contributions from: Jeff Klann, PhD; Andrew Cagan; Barbara Benoit
- Calculates 20 variables over the baseline period and computes an overall score, the highest scoring individuals are an approximation of those most likely present for future follow-up
- This script accepts an index_date and looks back n years previous to that date (baseline period).

## Outline of algorithm

1. Select all patients with a non-demographic fact between 1/1/2012 and the specified index date.

2. Determine which patients had visits of the required types between the index date and the index date minus the specified number of lookback years.

3. Determine which patients have facts of the required types between the index date and the index date minus the specified number of lookback years.

4. Compute average fact counts.

5. Compute Charlson score (by examining a set of diagnoses).

6. Save the final cohort table (`loyalty_dev`), Charlson scores (`loyalty_charlson_dev`), and generate summary statistics (loyalty_dev_summary) on the patients in the top quintile for highest loyalty score.
